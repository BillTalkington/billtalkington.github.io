Welcome to my site! 

My name is Bill. I'm currently a neuroscientist trying to transition into a web development career (details in a future post). On this site, I will be chronicling my progress to reach this goal. This will include resources that I find helpful, example projects I'm working on, as well as my general thought processes and motivations along the way. Towards the top of the project list is creating a custom theme for this site. So, if you're not seeing the default [Jekyll][jekyll] theme, I've made progress towards that goal! 

I'll also post about my other non-coding activities as well. These might include anything from gardening, permaculture, furniture restoration, woodworking, home improvement, etc.

I'm really looking forward to this site serving as a creative outlet. I hope that you can find some value in it as well!

Thanks for reading.

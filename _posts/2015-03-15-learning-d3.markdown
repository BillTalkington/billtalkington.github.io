I love maps. I especially love maps that tell me a story with data.

I have some county-level data that I have wanted to map for some time, so I started looking for a tool.
Looking around for a web-based mapping solution, I opted to try out [D3.js][d3-site]. I've read that the learning curve can be steep, but I can only imagine it's worth the effort having seen what it can do. 

Here, I will list the resources I have used to learn to plot the data and how to integrate D3 with Jekyll. Stay tuned!
